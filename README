# File and Directory Inventory Tool

## Overview

This Rust-based command-line tool efficiently inventories all files and subdirectories within a specified directory, categorizing files by their extensions. It's designed to provide a quick overview of the directory's contents, making it particularly useful for managing and analyzing large collections of files.

## Features

- **File Counting by Extension**: Counts the number of files for each file extension within the directory and its subdirectories.
- **Subdirectory Counting**: Tallies the total number of subdirectories within the specified directory.
- **Recursive Analysis**: Performs a deep analysis by recursively processing all subdirectories to ensure a comprehensive inventory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, follow the installation instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-directory-inventory.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd file-directory-inventory
    ```

3. Build the project using Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system):

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

4. The executable will be located in ./target/release/.

### Usage

To use this tool, simply run the executable from the command line, passing the target directory as an argument:

```sh
./target/release/file_directory_inventory <path_to_directory>
```

Replace `<path_to_directory>` with the path to the directory you wish to inventory.
